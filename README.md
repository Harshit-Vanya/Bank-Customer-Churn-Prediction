# Churn-Prediction
A deep learning-based project that predicts whether a bank customer will leave (churn) or stay, using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained on a real-world dataset containing customer demographics and banking activity. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
